            <p>To understand the behavior and needs of employees in Munich’s emerging tech scene and creating an experience to promote mobility, healthy living and an enjoyable work-life balance.
            <br><br>
            This project is a collaboration between <a href="https://www.adidas-group.com/en/" target="_blank">Adidas Group</a>, and <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/innovation/technologies-and-mobility.html" target="_blank">BMW Innovation Group</a>, with the aim to create a B2B2C mobility service which would launch in Munich, Germany in January 2018.
            </p>
            <p>This project is currently being implemented in beta mode.</p>

            <h2>Understanding current market and technology trends in sports and lifestyle habits</h2>
            <p>I conducted secondary research in three spaces that pertained to health, stakeholders involved, market and technology trends. The trends which stood out initially, grouped by category, were:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li><b>EAT</b> (trends in sustainability, availability of healthy foods at scale, and motivations leading to certain choices)</li>
                <li><b>MOVE</b>(trends in mobility, commuter behaviors, and pain points associated with transportation options)</li>
                <li><b>MIND</b>(trends in digital solutions for mindfulness, triggers for stress, and iOT solutions for biometric tracking)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our researched helped us narrow into the <b>MOVE</b> space and we focused on the following mobility framework to guide our designs:
            </p>

            <h4>Our project focuses on giving employees of large organizations an entry point to promoting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle</h4>

            <h3 id='s3' class='section'>OPPORTUNITY AREAS, IDEATION, CONCEPTS, PROTOTYPING & VALIDATION</h3>
                <p>Through an interactive design process, I was quickly moving between paper and digital <b>prototyping, testing </b>prototypes with users, and <b>co-creating</b> with and getting feedback from my project managers, engineers and artificial intelligence expert.
            </p>
                <br>
                <p>However, concepts cannot be disclosed online due to NDA, but please reach out to me @ trisha.suri@gmail.com for more details.

            <h3 id='s6' class='section'>REFLECTIONS</h3>
            <h2>Be collaborative, work fast</h2>
                <p>I had a hugely rewarding experience during my internship. I was the only female on the team, the only interaction designer,
                  and I was involved in every stage of the process from the initial brief (Adidas x BMW Partnership), user research, synthesis,
                  prototyping and user testing of the prototypes. I was also involved in the product management aspect of the project, closely
                  co-creating with the engineers and project managers to create a strategy and roadmap for the product, which I really enjoyed.</p><br><br>
            <h2>Feedback is a gift</h2>
                  <p>“Trisha brought great value to the team and contributed to the development of a mobile app and service for cyclists. During her time here she led the interaction design efforts within the team and applied design research and design thinking methods to generate user insights. She quickly adopted best practices in developing user-centric products, ideated concepts and solutions using agile methods and always made sure the team was following a user centered approach. Next to being a very talented designer, Trisha also showed very strong interpersonal skills and was able to motivate and guide the team through difficult challenges.”
