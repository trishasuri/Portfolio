            <p>With the increased popularity of sharing economy services, in particular, the rise of Airbnb, the hotel industry is required to stay innovative in its service offerings.
            <br><br>
            This project is a collaboration between <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">CMU</a>, <a href="https://www.m-iti.org/" target="_blank">M-ITI</a>,
            and <a href="https://www.portugalventures.pt/" target="_blank">Portugal Ventures</a>,with the aim to create a unique experience for hotel guests through HCI
            methodologies and research in an eight month intensive consulting project.
            <br><br>
            As the product lead, my role is to create the high level strategy for implementation of our MHCI team’s service and product offering. I also work closely with the UX
            and Design lead to create a high-fidelity prototype of our product to hand off for development.
            </p>
            <p>This project is still work-in-progress.</p>

            <h3 id='s2' class='section'>GETTING STARTED</h3>
            <h2>When researching travel, immerse yourself in the travel experience</h2>
            <p>We focused our research efforts on tourism through primary and secondary methods in Madeira, Portugal,
              a touristic island destination for many European travelers looking to get away from cold weather.<br><br>
              Our research methods included intercept interviews with tourists walking around the main streets of Funchal.
              We immersed ourselves in guided trips to understand and spend extended time with tourists in the settings
              they were discovering on the island. We also conducted rolling literature reviews on Madeiran tourism,
              hospitality industry research, and hotel innovation. <br><br>
              Through our intercept interviews, we were able to gather four key insights:<p>

            <ul class="text-list">
                <li><b>Tourists choose hotels for a set range of reasons</b></li>
                Hotels offer themes such as CR7, a Cristiano Ronaldo branded hotel,
                or some like the pricing model and concierge service offerings as opposed to Airbnb<br>
                <li><b>Tourists plan and do activities both independently and through guides</b></li>
                Travelers sometimes book activities pre-trip in advance through travel agents,
                or through a more ad-hoc approach during the trip<br>
                <li><b>Europeans choose Madeira for its climate and proximity</b></li>
                Travelers come to Madeira either to relax or for the outdoors<br>
                <li><b>Tourists approach travel differently</b></li>
                Some are loose planners, while others plan more in advance.
                Some travelers come to Madeira for short trips, while others stay for several weeks<br>
            </ul>

            <div class="project-img-div-med">

            <br>
            <h2>Explore existing models to discover new opportunities</h2>
            <br>

            <p>We moved to look more broadly at the ecosystem of hotels on the island.
              We researched other hotels on the island, and we read through and coded
              Trip Advisor reviews. We then went and did fly-on-the-wall observation
              sessions at some of the more prominent hotels in Funchal.<p>
                <ul class="text-list">
                    <li><b>Because travelers choose hotels over Airbnb when they want to interact with other people,
                      it is important to support human interactions.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Travelers choose resorts for ease and comfort. Traditional hotels are better suited to
                      travelers who want some independence.</b></li>
                    <li><b>While boutique hotels offer a specialized experience, our design for Tiles must be able to
                      support a wide variety of travelers and goals.</b></li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                <h2>Mapping service offerings and tech innovations in european hotels</h2>
                <br>

                <p>We then focused our research on the future state of hotels. We visited hotels and Airbnbs in mainland Portugal,
                  Italy, United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, and Netherlands to analyze and collect data on unique and exemplary services.
                  We conducted service safaris in 12 different hotels and mapped out service and tech innovations to understand current
                  offerings. We then considered the risks and successes shown by these tech-enabled experiences.<p>
                    <ul class="text-list">
                        <li><b>Because travelers choose hotels over Airbnb when they want to interact with other people,
                          it is important to support human interactions.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Travelers choose resorts for ease and comfort. Traditional hotels are better suited to
                          travelers who want some independence.</b></li>
                        <li><b>While boutique hotels offer a specialized experience, our design for Tiles must be able to
                          support a wide variety of travelers and goals.</b></li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><br>
                    <h2>The future of travel is about more information, empathy and awareness</h2>
                    <br>

                    <p>To supplement our research on visitors to Madeira, we reached out to frequent travelers who represented modern
                      attitudes and values. We found that many of their contributions validated our early findings, and drew valuable
                      insights that would help us flesh out opportunity areas for concept development.<br><br>
                      We discovered three key insights:<p>
                        <ul class="text-list">
                            <li><b>Authenticity is a priority</b></li>
                            <li><b>Small encounters are delightful</b></li>
                            <li><b>Information you can trust comes from real people</b></li>
                        </ul>

            <p>Our research lead us to believe there were five opportunity areas we could potentially focus on in our design phase.</p>

            <h3 id='s4' class='section'>CONCEPTS</h3>
            <h2>Narrow quickly and experiment often</h2>
            <p>We narrowed from five opportunity areas to three concepts that we wanted to test quickly.
            </p>
            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                    <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/DARPA/quotes-filter.png" alt="Users don't know what to look for">
            </div>
            <h4>Users were confused about the terms and the structure in initial iterations.</h4>
            <br>


            <p>While these prototypes are powerful in finding apps with specific purposes and permissions (e.g. find the apps that use my location data for ads), people were not able to effectively it. <b>There's a lot more education work to do.</b></p>
            <br>

            <h2>People think they care about privacy, but in reality, no so much</h2>
            <p>Another interesting finding from user interviews and tests is that people don't care about privacy as much as they think. During the tests, they often lacked the motivation to actually delve into privacy settings and manage.</p>

            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                    <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/DARPA/quotes-care.png" alt="Users don't care that much">

            <h4>Users don't actually care about privacy as much as they think.</h4>
            <br>

            <p>This means:</p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li><b>Install-time privacy setting UI is crucial. </b><br>It’s likely to be the only time that most users will review their privacy settings. (The install-time UI is still work-in-progress.)</li>
                <li><b>We need to convince people to care more.</b><br> Users don't about their privacy as much as they think.</li>
                <li><b>We need to further simplify the configuration.</b></li>
                    <ul class="text-list">
                        <li>Minimize the number of clicks needed to set things up</li>
                        <li>Less text, more icons, easier to read with progressive disclosure</li>

                <p><b>We can only expect behavioral change after emotional and cognitive change.</b> After all, the goal is to help users best protect their mobile privacy.</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Onboarding tutorial helped users learn about data privacy and build up the mental model</h2>
                <p><b>Action:</b> I created an onboarding tutorial to educate users of their data privacy, introducing the concept of permissions, purposes, and third-party libraries.<br>
                <b>Result:</b> Users were able to have a much more clear mental model when they go into settings. </p>

                <h4>Onboarding tutorial explains permissions, purposes, and third-party libraries</h4>

                <br>
                <h2>A more exploratory design lead to less confused and more engaged users</h2>
                <p><b>Action:</b> Instead of just giving users category titles of privacy data, I decided to show more detailed examples of apps and types of privacy information upfront, to help users explore possibilities.<br>
                <b>Result:</b> Users expressed fewer confusions, became more engaged, and showed more interest in managing their data privacy.</p>

                <p><b>Action:</b> While users can still micro-manage every single privacy setting, I also made the "Apply Recommended Settings" a prominent call-to-action. The user can preview the recommended settings before deciding whether to apply. <br>
                <b>Result:</b> Users, "Whew, this is so much easier! I trust Android's judgment."</p>

                <p>I'm continuing to work on this project in the spring semester. There are a lot more things to be explored, such as designing effective install-time UI, making the prototype more high-fidelity, and evaluating the effective of the current iteration with more users, etc. </p>

            <h3 id='s6' class='section'>REFLECTIONS</h3>
            <h2>Always validate design assumptions with users</h2>
                <p>Designers and engineers often know “too much” to make good assumptions about the product or the user. Had I not test my early iterations with real users, I would not have changed my focus from how can I allow users to flexibly manage their data privacy, to how can I encourage them the care about data privacy and explore the possibilities.</p>

            <h2>Be proactive, be collaborative</h2>
                <p>As this is an independent study project, I was managing my own workflow and deadlines. I was proactive through the entire process, communicating with my team, collecting feedback, and getting the resources when needed. The help, insights, and co-creation I received from my advisor, the engineers I worked with, peer designers, and users were invaluable. All these brought me closer to achieving the initial project goals.</p>

            <br><br>
