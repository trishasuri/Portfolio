            <h3 id='s1' class='section'>BRIEF</h3>
            <p>With the increased popularity of sharing economy services, in particular, the rise of Airbnb, the hotel industry is required to stay innovative in its service offerings.
            <br><br>
            This project is a collaboration between <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">CMU</a>, <a href="https://www.m-iti.org/" target="_blank">M-ITI</a>,
            and <a href="https://www.portugalventures.pt/" target="_blank">Portugal Ventures</a>,with the aim to create a unique experience for hotel guests through HCI
            methodologies and research in an eight month intensive consulting project.
            <br><br>
            As the product lead, my role is to create the high level strategy for implementation of our MHCI teamâ€™s service and product offering. I also work closely with the UX
            and Design lead to create a high-fidelity prototype of our product to hand off for development.
            </p>
            <p>This project is still work-in-progress.</p>

            <h3 id='s2' class='section'>GETTING STARTED</h3>
            <h2>When researching travel, immerse yourself in the travel experience</h2>
            <p>We focused our research efforts on tourism through primary and secondary methods in Madeira, Portugal,
              a touristic island destination for many European travelers looking to get away from cold weather.<br><br>
              Our research methods included intercept interviews with tourists walking around the main streets of Funchal.
              We immersed ourselves in guided trips to understand and spend extended time with tourists in the settings
              they were discovering on the island. We also conducted rolling literature reviews on Madeiran tourism,
              hospitality industry research, and hotel innovation. <br><br>
              Through our intercept interviews, we were able to gather four key insights:<p>

            <ul class="text-list">
                <li><b>Tourists choose hotels for a set range of reasons</b></li>
                Hotels offer themes such as CR7, a Cristiano Ronaldo branded hotel,
                or some like the pricing model and concierge service offerings as opposed to Airbnb<br>
                <li><b>Tourists plan and do activities both independently and through guides</b></li>
                Travelers sometimes book activities pre-trip in advance through travel agents,
                or through a more ad-hoc approach during the trip<br>
                <li><b>Europeans choose Madeira for its climate and proximity</b></li>
                Travelers come to Madeira either to relax or for the outdoors<br>
                <li><b>Tourists approach travel differently</b></li>
                Some are loose planners, while others plan more in advance.
                Some travelers come to Madeira for short trips, while others stay for several weeks<br>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>Explore existing models to discover new opportunities</h2>
            <br>

            <p>We moved to look more broadly at the ecosystem of hotels on the island.
              We researched other hotels on the island, and we read through and coded
              Trip Advisor reviews. We then went and did fly-on-the-wall observation
              sessions at some of the more prominent hotels in Funchal.<p>
                <ul class="text-list">
                    <li><b>Because travelers choose hotels over Airbnb when they want to interact with other people,
                      it is important to support human interactions.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Travelers choose resorts for ease and comfort. Traditional hotels are better suited to
                      travelers who want some independence.</b></li>
                    <li><b>While boutique hotels offer a specialized experience, our design for Tiles must be able to
                      support a wide variety of travelers and goals.</b></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Mapping service offerings and tech innovations in european hotels</h2>
                <br>

                <p>We then focused our research on the future state of hotels. We visited hotels and Airbnbs in mainland Portugal,
                  Italy, United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, and Netherlands to analyze and collect data on unique and exemplary services.
                  We conducted service safaris in 12 different hotels and mapped out service and tech innovations to understand current
                  offerings. We then considered the risks and successes shown by these tech-enabled experiences.<p>
                    <ul class="text-list">
                        <li><b>Because travelers choose hotels over Airbnb when they want to interact with other people,
                          it is important to support human interactions.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Travelers choose resorts for ease and comfort. Traditional hotels are better suited to
                          travelers who want some independence.</b></li>
                        <li><b>While boutique hotels offer a specialized experience, our design for Tiles must be able to
                          support a wide variety of travelers and goals.</b></li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><br>
                    <h2>The future of travel is about more information, empathy and awareness</h2>
                    <br>

                    <p>To supplement our research on visitors to Madeira, we reached out to frequent travelers who represented modern
                      attitudes and values. We found that many of their contributions validated our early findings, and drew valuable
                      insights that would help us flesh out opportunity areas for concept development.<br><br>
                      We discovered three key insights:<p>
                        <ul class="text-list">
                            <li><b>Authenticity is a priority</b></li>
                            <li><b>Small encounters are delightful</b></li>
                            <li><b>Information you can trust comes from real people</b></li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Get attached to the problem and not your solution</h2>
                <p>We realized early on the hospitality industry and the hotel space in general was restrictive.
                  It was important to map out the entire flow of every system the hotel currently used to see where our
                  design idea could thrive. We are currently in the prototyping phase and will start conducting user tests
                at the hotel in the next weeks.</p>
